                        Skinalyze is a responsive web app designed for early detection of skin cancer using the MobileNetV3Large 
                        deep learning model. Users can upload skin lesion images, which are analyzed to classify seven types of 
                        skin cancer. It integrates Groq AI to provide context-aware descriptions and care suggestions based on 
                        results. Additionally, it features real-time UV index detection based on user location, offering preventive 
                        guidance to lower skin cancer risk.

                        As a backend developer, I contributed to building "Satu Data Gaprang", a Laravel-based website created

                        data filtering, searching, and import/export functionality. It provides a tailored data management experience, 
                        particularly helpful for distributing social and infrastructure aid based on organized, queryable citizen records.

                        This project focused on analyzing the historical stock data and revenue of Tesla and GameStop using data 
                        science techniques. I scraped financial data from public sources, cleaned and visualized it, then compared 
                        stock performance and revenue over time. The Tesla data from 2010 onwards showed a strong correlation between 
                        stock prices and revenue, while GameStop's data revealed a weaker or inverse pattern-highlighting unique market 
                        behavior during periods like the 2017-2021 retail investor surge.

                    <p class="project-4">
                        In this project, I used the Merlion library to forecast Bitcoin prices and detect anomalies in the time series 
                        data. Using a one-year dataset in Indonesian Rupiah, I performed anomaly detection and forecasting with clear 
                        visualizations. The results showed that while mild anomalies could be identified, forecasting remained challenging 
                        due to extreme volatility, as seen in December when actual prices vastly outperformed predictions. I also deployed 
                        the project with an interactive dashboard using Merlion's built-in server.
